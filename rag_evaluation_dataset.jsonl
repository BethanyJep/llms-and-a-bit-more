They can also perform various language tasks, such as translation, summarisation, and content generation. Large Language Models A subset of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It uses statistical techniques to allow computers to \u201clearn\u201d from data and identify patterns. Machine Learning Computational models inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, consisting of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process and transmit information, enabling complex pattern recognition and problem- solving capabilities. Neural Networks A hybrid AI approach that combines information retrieval from a knowledge base with generative AI capabilities. Grounding generated content in verified information enables more accurate and contextually relevant responses. Retrieval- Augmented Generation Compact versions of larger language models designed to operate efficiently on less powerful devices or within constrained computational environments. Small Language Models 17 / Kenya AI Strategy age of 19, the country\u2019s population is highly engaged with technology, seeking digital solutions in everyday life. Kenya has several start-ups leveraging AI technologies to enhance their offerings in various sectors and has already raised millions of dollars in venture capital investments. In the private sector, homegrown large corporations in the telecommunications and banking sectors are also innovating with AI technologies to enhance customer experience, detect fraud, and improve operational efficiency. Global tech companies have also set up research centres in Kenya to tackle challenges in healthcare, agriculture, 1.2. Background Kenya is a leading hub for technology and innovation in Africa, and artificial intelligence is increasingly playing a significant role in its digital landscape. Several initiatives have already been established in the country to leverage AI technology, supported by a robust digital infrastructure and driven by a combination of government support, private- sector innovation, development partners, and academic research. As of March 2024, Kenya had 22.71 million internet users, translating to an internet penetration rate of 40.8% and a mobile penetration rate of 118% with 68 million mobile cellular connections. With a median 18 / Kenya AI Strategy and financial services, among other sectors. Recently, partnerships have been announced on AI infrastructure, including establishing a state-of-the-art green data centre and an East Africa Innovation Lab focused on broad AI digital skills training. Kenya has made significant strides in developing its digital infrastructure. This uptake is a result of extensive investments in infrastructure and the proliferation of affordable internet services. The country\u2019s rapid adoption of internet and mobile technologies has transformed its economic, social, and cultural landscapes. For instance, the government has prioritised the development of digital government services, such as its eCitizen portal, which provides online access to various public services, enhancing efficient and accessible service delivery for all citizens. Investments in terrestrial fibre networks have increased the reach of high-speed internet to various parts of the country, including previously underserved regions. Currently, the National Optic Fibre Network Backhaul Initiative, in\n\nseen through governance practices of the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States, reflecting a growing recognition of the need for ethical AI usage characterised by the different approaches to AI governance, including human-centric, risk- based, and safety-based. Regulatory bodies like the Federal Trade Commission in the United States have taken enforcement actions against tech companies like Amazon for privacy violations related to 3.3. Political Environment AI technologies. The cases brought against Amazon for its Alexa app and Ring cameras resulted in the company agreeing to the deletion of certain data and prohibitions against using certain information for model training. Countries, organisations, and international and regional bodies are increasingly focusing on developing ethical AI frameworks to ensure the responsible and transparent use of AI technologies. Initiatives such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) AI Principles, UNESCO\u2019s Recommendation on the Ethics of AI, the African Union Continental AI Strategy, and the European Union AI Act aim to establish ethical AI development and deployment guidelines. Efforts are underway to harmonise AI regulations across borders to facilitate international cooperation and ensure governance consistency. Multilateral organisations like the OECD, UNESCO, and the European Union are working on frameworks to address global challenges posed by AI technologies. 3.3.2. Regional Context A number of African countries have formulated national AI strategies to drive innovation, economic growth, and societal development. These strategies outline priorities for AI research, development, readiness measurement, and deployment while emphasising ethical considerations and human-centric approaches to AI governance. Further, national AI strategies have become the foundation for AI governance in the African continent, where there is a notable increase in the development of national AI strategies. These efforts are likely to grow in the coming years, as evidenced by the 35 / Kenya AI Strategy ongoing initiatives to guide AI development and integrate it into national development plans. Developed and developing countries emphasise the importance of ethical AI practices, especially for African nations, mirroring trends in developed countries where ethical considerations are a focus in AI policy discussions. Additionally, there is a growing trend towards regional cooperation in AI governance. The recent adoption of the African Union Continental Artificial Intelligence Strategy points towards a continental focus on AI governance. In both developed economies and African nations, the private sector increasingly adopts AI solutions across various industries, such as finance, healthcare, and agriculture. The private sector continues to play a significant role in driving AI innovation and efficiency, which is seen to be essential to overall economic growth. Key opportunities will derive from integrating AI into national development plans, presenting opportunities for economic growth, innovation, and improved public service delivery, further contextualising areas of focus in AI governance. Given African countries\u2019 varied approaches, regulatory harmonisation presents a challenge, making international cooperation in creating cohesive development practices and frameworks crucial. The East African Community member countries have also established foundational frameworks where data sharing and data protection is concerned, such as in trade, health, data protection, education standards, and financial services. These foundations become near-future enablers for harmonised AI regulations. 3.3.3. National Context Kenya has shown political will to advance AI adoption by prioritising emerging technologies and AI in the National Digital Economy Blueprint, where AI is referenced as a tool for driving innovation-driven entrepreneurship, and the Kenya National Digital Master Plan (2022\u20132032), which notes the importance of a national strategy on AI and key focus areas that need to be addressed. Kenya also made commitments to build an AI-powered smart city, the Konza Technopolis, which currently houses the country\u2019s data centre. Additionally, the Technopolis authorities signed a memorandum of understanding with a cyberschool to facilitate training of Kenyan youth on AI and cybersecurity, while the African Centre for Technology Studies is planning to establish an AI centre of excellence at the Technopolis. Other agencies, such as the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, have embraced AI in their operations such as Linda Data, a platform on which citizens can interact with an AI-powered chatbot to address data protection queries, raising awareness that can ultimately be used to scale the citizen information repository whose effective use can inform the ethical AI framework for the country. The nation\u2019s statistical organisation, the Kenya National Bureau of Standards, is committed to expanding the mandate of data and evidence generation through its recently launched data centre. 36 / Kenya AI Strategy 3.4. Legal and Regulatory Environment 3.4.1. Global Context The rapid advancement of AI technologies has prompted the development of global policy and legal regulatory frameworks to ensure their ethical and responsible use. These frameworks vary by region and organisation but share common goals, including promoting innovation, protecting human rights, governing administration, and mitigating risks associated with AI. The Global AI Law and Policy Tracker offers an extensive overview of AI governance frameworks across various countries and jurisdictions. The AI Equality Initiative has established a community of practice towards empowered ethical AI, which considers a just, responsible, and inclusive AI global ecosystem. The initiative proposes a global AI observatory model to inform policy development. Though progress remains slow, 2023 saw a substantial increase from the previous year in the number of countries with laws that include the term \u201cAI\u201d (127 in 2023 compared to 25 in 2022), an indication of the growing recognition of the need for regulatory frameworks and AI governance. Additionally, diverse legislative approaches are being pursued. The European Union, for instance, has been at the forefront of building a robust AI regulatory framework by adopting the EU AI Act, which came into force on 1 August 2024 across all 27 European Union member states. The EU AI Act takes a distinctly risk-based approach towards regulating AI, imposing regulatory burdens only when an AI system is likely to pose high risks to fundamental rights and safety. The Act establishes a tiered framework that classifies risk into four categories: unacceptable risks that lead to 37 / Kenya AI Strategy prohibited practices; high risks that trigger a set of stringent obligations, some of which\n\nvarious countries and jurisdictions.

The United States, on the other hand, has so far issued an executive order on the Safe, Secure and Trustworthy Development and Use of AI, as well as the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, which sets out five principles and associated practices to guide the design, use, and deployment of automated systems to protect the rights of the American public. The United Kingdom has taken a more safety- based approach towards the governance of AI, fortified during its AI Safety Summit 2023, which advanced the establishment of AI safety institutes, global commitments by tech companies united to establish science and empirically led guidelines, standards, and collaborations. The Bletchley Declaration, a product of the summit, advocates for the need to identify AI risks and inform risk-based policy development. In Colombia, initiatives like the AI Expert Mission and AI National Strategy Policy have been implemented. The United States has released multiple frameworks and guidelines to maintain its leadership in AI research and control government use of AI. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has issued guidelines to prevent biassed or unfair AI use, while Singapore\u2019s Personal Data Protection Commission offers advisory guidelines to support AI implementation while maintaining data protection. The previously mentioned EU AI Act introduced harmonised rules for AI in the European Union market with a risk-based approach, prohibiting specific AI systems, and imposing requirements and transparency rules on high-risk systems. Australia\u2019s 2021 AI Action Plan aims to build AI capability and promote trusted, secure AI technologies. Privacy enforcement authorities (PEAs) across various jurisdictions have taken significant actions in response to privacy concerns surrounding AI technologies, particularly generative AI like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. In Canada, the Federal Office of the Privacy Commissioner and provincial privacy authorities launched an investigation into ChatGPT for processing personal data without consent. This investigation was expanded to include assessments of OpenAI\u2019s compliance with transparency, access, accuracy, and accountability principles. Similarly, Italy\u2019s PEA (Garante) temporarily blocked OpenAI from processing personal data due to potential General Data Protection Regulation violations, which included issues related to transparency and data protection by design. Japan\u2019s Personal Information Protection Commission warned OpenAI about collecting sensitive data without consent, emphasising the need for clear notices in Japanese about data collection purposes. In Korea, the Personal Information Protection Commission fined OpenAI for not notifying the public of a data breach and identified multiple non-compliance issues with the country\u2019s Personal Information Protection Act, including the lack of clarity in the controller-processor relationship and absence of parental consent for children under 14. The United Kingdom\u2019s Information Commissioner\u2019s Office has also been active, fining Clearview AI for unauthorised use of facial images and issuing enforcement notices to Snap Inc. regarding the privacy risks posed by its generative AI chatbot My AI. In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission has taken multiple enforcement actions involving AI, including cases against Rite Aid for biased facial recognition technology and Amazon for violations related to its Alexa app and Ring cameras. Internationally, the European Data Protection Board formed a task force to enhance cooperation and information exchange in 38 / Kenya AI Strategy handling complaints and investigations into OpenAI and ChatGPT at the European Union level. The Ibero-American Network of Data Protection initiated a coordinated action on ChatGPT compliance among its member countries. These actions underscore the commonalities in legal obligations regarding the processing of personal data by generative AI and highlight the importance of international cooperation in enforcing privacy laws. The OECD is also revising its Recommendation on Cross-Border Cooperation in the Enforcement of Laws Protecting Privacy to strengthen these collaborative efforts. Privacy enforcement authorities collaborate globally, as evidenced by statements and resolutions on generative AI from Group of 7 countries and the Global Privacy Assembly. Various privacy enforcement authorities have issued guidance on applying privacy laws to AI, with notable initiatives in Canada, France, Spain, T\u00fcrkiye, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Singapore. These include principles for responsible AI development, action plans, compliance guidance, and frameworks to ensure AI technologies align with privacy regulations. For instance, France\u2019s Commission Nationale de l\u2019informatique et des Libert\u00e9s (National Commission of Informatics and Liberty) has developed an action plan for AI that respects privacy, and the United Kingdom\u2019s Information Commissioner\u2019s Office has provided comprehensive AI and data protection guidance. 3.4.2. Regional Context A quick survey of AI governance in Africa shows increased AI policy initiatives, primarily national AI strategies. The governance of AI in Africa takes a varied approach.

Recognising the transformative potential of AI, the strategy also commits to safeguarding national interests by embedding robust data sovereignty, a cybersecurity framework, and ethical oversight in AI deployment. These measures will ensure that Kenya\u2019s AI ecosystem is secure and equitable. The strategy provides a comprehensive framework to guide Kenya in harnessing the transformative power of AI, ensuring its deployment benefits all sectors of society while adhering to ethical principles and inclusivity. Developed through extensive consultations with government agencies, private-sector stakeholders, academia, civil society, international partners, and local communities, the strategy reflects a participatory approach that aligns with Kenya\u2019s national values and development goals while embracing diverse perspectives. At the core of this strategy is Kenya\u2019s aspiration to adopt AI technologies and lead in AI model innovation, R&D and commercialisation, creating solutions tailored to its unique needs and those of the African continent. The objectives include establishing a robust governance framework for AI; enhancing adoption in key sectors such as agriculture, security, healthcare, education, and public service delivery; and fostering the growth of local AI ecosystems. Additionally, the strategy prioritises inclusivity to ensure underserved communities are not left behind and aims to position Kenya as the preferred regional hub for AI research, model development, and scalable innovation. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 8 / Kenya AI Strategy The strategy is anchored by three key pillars and supported by four enablers. The first pillar is AI digital infrastructure, which underscores the need for accessible and affordable AI infrastructure and a modernised national digital infrastructure for AI access and development.

Increased foundational awareness of AI \u2022 % increase of public awareness of AI 83 / Kenya AI Strategy The Kenyan government and ecosystem stakeholders have identified several high- priority use cases across key sectors aligned with Kenya\u2019s Bottom-up Economic Transformation Agenda and corresponding pillars in Kenya\u2019s Vision 2030. The key sectors prioritised for this strategy include healthcare; education; agriculture; public service delivery; security; micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises; the creative sector; and sustainability. Use cases for these sectors will be prioritised based on their feasibility, potential impact, and alignment with existing data availability and strategic goals and objectives. In this vein, the government has already identified use cases within the AI ecosystem in the area of natural language processing involving large language models. In healthcare, two critical use cases are under 5.3. Priority Use Case consideration: a maternal health chatbot in local dialects to provide accurate pregnancy and childbirth information, and an expanded disease advisory system building on existing platforms. The education sector has prioritised intelligent tutoring systems and multilingual teacher training modules to improve access and quality of instruction. For agriculture, emerging use cases include translating existing data into farmer-friendly audio formats in local languages and developing AI- powered fertilizer recommendation systems.

Kenya also has access to clean and green energy, particularly geothermal, which provides a strategic advantage in developing AI infrastructure, such as green data centres with minimal environmental impact. Political will and strong government support for the adoption of AI The government has provided political backing for the development of AI in Kenya through participation and ratification of global events and issues on AI; prioritisation of AI through the establishment of the 2019 Distributed Ledgers (Blockchain) and Artificial Intelligence Taskforce and the Sectoral Working Group; and the development of a national AI strategy. The government has mobilised financing and resources for local AI development by facilitating strategic investments from international partners, e.g., the commitment by Microsoft and G42 for a $1 billion digital ecosystem initiative to set up green infrastructure and local language models. There are also existing initiatives in the public sector, including the establishment of the AI-powered Konza smart city, the use of AI in healthcare resource allocation, and deployment of chatbots that support digital service delivery and citizen engagement. Kenya is a regional hub/gateway to the East & Central Africa region The presence of homegrown companies and tech startups building AI tools as well as global tech companies setting up research centres provides evidence of Kenya\u2019s status as a regional leader. Kenya\u2019s existing digital infrastructure, such as the National Optic Fibre Backbone Network Initiative, aim to enhance connectivity across all counties, making the country an attractive destination for technology companies interested in expanding to the region. Kenya\u2019s commitments to building smart cities like Konza Technopolis and existing partnerships for AI training and innovation also demonstrate its capacity as a regional leader. 55 / Kenya AI Strategy Limitation Key Evidence AI skills gap Kenya faces a huge shortage of advanced-level AI experts with the skills to design and train contextually relevant AI models. This skills gap can slow down AI development, limit innovation, and force reliance on foreign expertise, thereby reducing Kenya\u2019s competitiveness in AI. Primary data collection also indicates mismatches between academic training and practical industry needs that limit the ability to further homegrown innovation and effective adoption and maintenance of AI technologies. (Expand this definition to include different types of skills to include non tech professionals) Regulatory gaps and conflicts Kenya does not have a comprehensive and specific regulatory framework for AI. While existing legal frameworks such as the Data Protection, Computer Misuse and Cybercrime, Intellectual Property, and Consumers Acts provide some guidance, they are insufficient to address the complexities of AI. There is no specific policy on AI. These policy and regulatory gaps create governance challenges in managing ethical concerns, data privacy, and the safe deployment of AI technologies.

Additionally, there was a strong demand for independent bodies to oversee AI implementation, evaluate AI projects, and conduct regular impact assessments on the effects of AI deployments. 49 / Kenya AI Strategy 3.7. Stakeholder Analysis 3.7.1. Background Stakeholder mapping is a crucial process in developing a national AI strategy, involving identifying and analysing individuals, groups, and organisations that have an interest or stake in the strategy\u2019s outcomes. According to Bryson (2004 ), stakeholder mapping systematically identifies and analyses stakeholders to understand their influence and importance in decision-making processes. This process helps identify the diverse perspectives, interests, and potential impacts on various sectors of society, ensuring that the strategy is comprehensive and inclusive. The primary purpose of stakeholder mapping is to facilitate effective engagement, foster collaboration, and mitigate risks by understanding the needs and expectations of different stakeholders. Doing so ensures that the AI strategy is aligned with national priorities, ethical standards, and the long- term goals of sustainable development. 3.7.2. Justification This stakeholder mapping exercise is based on the normative stakeholder theory and the evolving theory of property. To contextualise the AI ecosystem, an African lens is applied in when mapping stakeholders, which presents the ideology that the African AI ecosystem can be described by identifying stakeholders categorised based on normative claims. The normative claims derive from the normative stakeholder theory, which is a critical guide in ethical decision-making in the AI ecosystem. This theory centres on prioritising stakeholders and identifying their obligations and responsibilities. The normative claim is based on the evolving theory of property, which posits that property rights are embedded in human rights, necessitating the consideration of the interests of all stakeholders, including non-owner stakeholders. Stakeholders are categorised based on the normative claims they can make on the AI system, focusing on fair economic opportunity, political equality, and authenticity. This approach emphasises the importance of considering ethical and moral considerations in decision-making processes related to AI development, adoption, and policy formulation. The normative stakeholder theory identifies a range of potential obligations that corporations operating in developing countries may take on, focusing on the commitments of groups of stakeholders rather than individual entities in specific situations. Therefore, in bringing this together to define responsible AI, the strategy defines responsible AI within Africa by emphasising the importance of considering diverse perspectives and ensuring equitable outcomes for all stakeholders involved in the AI ecosystem. Responsible AI, in this framework, involves addressing power dynamics, information asymmetries, and intersecting interests among stakeholders to create an AI ecosystem that is fair, inclusive, and beneficial to everyone. The focus is on identifying disparities in power, understanding relationships and power dynamics between different groups, and ensuring that the development and adoption of AI technology consider the needs and perspectives of all stakeholders. By characterising stakeholders\u2019 interactions, interests, responsibilities, and accountability, the aim is to promote responsible AI practices, prioritising equity and inclusivity. Following from this, these are eight main groups considered during the stakeholder mapping and their indices based on their interest and influence over this strategy document.

These include AI developers, communities, regulatory agencies, researchers, and investors, as shown in Figure 3.1. 53 / Kenya AI Strategy Strength Key Evidence Existing diverse and vibrant local innovation ecosystem There is a vibrant ecosystem of local startups creating\n\ncould stifle innovation, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises. The FGDs also highlighted the urgent need for capacity-building. Kenya has a shortage of specialised AI professionals, and academic institutions often lag in aligning their curricula with industry needs. The academic FGD raised concerns about curriculum development and funding challenges, particularly in public universities. Participants advocated for collaborative AI innovation hubs and strong public-private innovation networks. Recommendations included introducing AI education at earlier levels of schooling, promoting research funding, and fostering international partnerships for knowledge exchange. Infrastructure and investment needs dominated many discussions. Participants called for strategic government investments in data centres, cloud computing, edge nodes, and mobile data businesses. They emphasised the need for market- friendly policies to encourage investment while reducing regulatory uncertainty. 47 / Kenya AI Strategy 3.6.3. Town Hall Meetings Town hall meetings provided a platform for diverse stakeholders, including citizens and technology practitioners in different regions of Kenya, to voice their perspectives on AI development. The town hall meetings revealed broad public interest in AI\u2019s potential across multiple sectors, including health, education, creative industries, media, agriculture, and public services. Participants shared opportunities for AI to improve service delivery, particularly for people with disabilities, and enhance public sector efficiency. However, a number of town hall participants were concerned about limited access to AI technology, widening of the digital divide, and the risk of exacerbating existing inequalities. Participants also raised fears about job displacement, particularly in labour-intensive industries, due to task automation. Similarly, concerns were raised about the shortage of specialised skills for local AI development. All town hall meetings repeatedly raised the issue that AI use could lead to threats to general and personal well-being, including risks to critical thinking and creativity, the spread of misinformation, and data privacy issues. Town hall discussions were centred on ethical considerations with participants, similar to FGD respondents, stressing the importance of aligning AI systems with Kenyan cultural norms and values. Public awareness campaigns were proposed to educate citizens on AI\u2019s benefits and risks, fostering trust and inclusivity. Moreover, employing universal design to AI systems built in would increase their utility to everyone, including individuals with disabilities. Despite these concerns, town hall discussions highlighted significant opportunities for economic growth. AI-driven personalization could enhance citizen engagement, while 48 / Kenya AI Strategy innovations tailored to local needs could address pressing societal challenges such as poverty and health disparities. The town halls also produced several key recommendations. On infrastructure and access, participants believed it was imperative that all Kenyans can access AI and that it was necessary to increase access to smartphones and accelerate digitisation efforts. There was also an emphasis on prioritising local datasets and including indigenous knowledge in AI development. The town hall discussions made recommendations to create unified legal frameworks and ethical guidelines for AI development and to ensure that governance and regulatory frameworks remain agile to accommodate the evolving nature of AI technologies. Participants also called for increased investments in infrastructure, such as data centres and connectivity, to support AI deployment at scale. Additionally, participants made recommendations for professional upskilling programmes and public awareness campaigns. Participants called for consideration of a welfare system for workers displaced by AI automation, highlighting the need to manage AI\u2019s social impact thoughtfully and proactively. All town halls emphasised that it was necessary to develop robust public-private partnerships, international collaborations, and government leadership to drive AI adoption in Kenya. Throughout all discussions, participants emphasised the importance of balancing innovation with responsible development and ensuring that AI advancement benefits all Kenyans. 3.6.4. Online Survey We received responses from 17 counties across Kenya, with participants representing various sectors. The majority of responses came from academia, civil society, and the for-profit sector, with some input from government, media, and multilateral agency representatives. Respondents identified key opportunities for AI, particularly in economic growth, education, healthcare improvement, environmental sustainability, and the efficient provision of public services. However, they also expressed significant concerns, mainly focused on ethical considerations, privacy issues, and security risks. Survey participants provided insight into their priorities for an AI strategy. The top priorities, in order of consensus, included research and development, education and workforce training, ethical guidelines and regulations, healthcare and agriculture, and public awareness and engagement. There were divergent views among respondents regarding AI regulation. One group emphasised the importance of allowing AI to develop its potential before imposing regulations, with public participation shaping policy. In contrast, another group stressed the need for clear policies, laws, and a national strategy to ensure ethical AI development from the outset. A majority of respondents underscored the necessity of transparency in AI decision-making processes to build public trust. They advocated for AI algorithms to be subject to public scrutiny. Moreover, respondents called for public awareness campaigns to educate citizens about AI\u2019s benefits, risks, and ethical implications. Inclusivity emerged as a crucial consideration, with respondents urging that AI systems be designed to consider diverse populations to ensure equitable outcomes. Additionally, there was a strong demand for independent bodies to oversee AI implementation, evaluate AI projects, and conduct regular impact assessments on the effects of AI deployments. 49 / Kenya AI Strategy 3.7.

INTRODUCTION 14 / Kenya AI Strategy The National Strategy on Artificial Intelligence for Kenya was written to harness the transformative potential of AI to drive the country\u2019s socioeconomic development. This strategy is a proactive and ambitious roadmap to position Kenya as an African leader in AI by creating an action plan for a robust, inclusive, and sustainable AI-driven future. It ensures that emerging technologies are leveraged to achieve national priorities, enhance public services, and promote inclusive economic growth. This strategy provides a comprehensive approach to ensure that Kenya can effectively navigate the complexities of AI development and adoption in our context, mitigate potential risks, and capitalise on the opportunities presented by AI technologies. This strategic plan will guide the development, deployment, and governance of AI in Kenya and the integration of AI into various sectors, building a skilled workforce and ensuring that AI contributes to the nation\u2019s growth and development while safeguarding the rights and well-being of its citizens by addressing regulatory and ethical considerations. This strategy centres on the Kenyan citizen: it empowers Kenyans by providing them with the tools and opportunities to participate actively in the digital economy, improve their livelihoods, and enhance their quality of life. Artificial intelligence has revolutionised industries, driven innovation, and reshaped economies globally. AI technologies enhance productivity, enable smarter decision-making, and create new economic opportunities. AI is being used to solve complex problems, improve efficiency, and deliver personalised services. For Kenya, the potential of AI is immense. As a leading hub for technology and innovation in Africa, Kenya is well positioned to provide leadership and set the pace for how AI can be applied to address our unique challenges and drive sustainable development. By integrating AI into critical sectors\u2014including agriculture, healthcare, finance, and education\u2014Kenya can achieve significant socioeconomic gains, reduce inequalities, and improve the quality of life for its citizens. The National AI Strategy aims to unlock these potentials, positioning Kenya to maximise the benefits of AI, promoting innovation and economic growth while safeguarding our national interests, and ensuring ethical and inclusive AI practices that align with our values and development goals. It is important to note that while AI offers opportunities to transform our country in various sectors and public service, its adoption must be balanced with measures to address potential risks. The misuse of AI\u2014to launch automated cyberattacks, disinformation campaigns, or unauthorised surveillance\u2014poses significant challenges. Kenya\u2019s AI Strategy will prioritise frameworks that safeguard against such threats while driving innovation. 15 / Kenya AI Strategy 1.1. Key Definitions This section defines key terms in this strategy document. By defining these terms, we aim to ensure a common language and shared understanding among all stakeholders, facilitating effective\n\ndigital infrastructure and driven by a combination of government support, private- sector innovation, development partners, and academic research. As of March 2024, Kenya had 22.71 million internet users, translating to an internet penetration rate of 40.8% and a mobile penetration rate of 118% with 68 million mobile cellular connections. With a median 18 / Kenya AI Strategy and financial services, among other sectors. Recently, partnerships have been announced on AI infrastructure, including establishing a state-of-the-art green data centre and an East Africa Innovation Lab focused on broad AI digital skills training. Kenya has made significant strides in developing its digital infrastructure. This uptake is a result of extensive investments in infrastructure and the proliferation of affordable internet services. The country\u2019s rapid adoption of internet and mobile technologies has transformed its economic, social, and cultural landscapes. For instance, the government has prioritised the development of digital government services, such as its eCitizen portal, which provides online access to various public services, enhancing efficient and accessible service delivery for all citizens. Investments in terrestrial fibre networks have increased the reach of high-speed internet to various parts of the country, including previously underserved regions. Currently, the National Optic Fibre Network Backhaul Initiative, in partnership with the private sector and other key infrastructure partners, is aiming to deploy over 100,000 km of optic fibre by 2027.
